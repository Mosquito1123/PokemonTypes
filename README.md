## Development

To run Pokémon Types you must have [NativeScript installed on your development machine](https://docs.nativescript.org/start/quick-setup). Once that’s ready to go, clone this repo and `cd` into its directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/tjvantoll/pokemon-types.git
cd pokemon-types
```

Next, use NativeScript’s `tns run` command to run the app on either iOS or Android.

```
tns run ios
```

Or

```
tns run android
```
